# SLIC-Superpixels
This project simply calls upon the already implemented SLIC superpixel methods implemented by OpenCV to see how the various methods change the resulting superpixel image. UI implemented as well.

## Usage:
<pre>
slic [-h] -t input_image -s scaling_factor
    -t : Target Image (t)
    -s : Image Scaling Factor (s)
            </pre>
